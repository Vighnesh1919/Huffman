Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm.It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.The idea is to compress data by replacing more frequent characters with shorter codes and less frequent characters with longer codes.This approach reduces the overall size of the data being compressed.Huffman coding is widely used in various applications, including file compression and image processing.
